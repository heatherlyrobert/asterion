.SH NAME
asterion_minotaur \- radial convergence navigator for c code

.SH IMAGERY (see HERITAGE at bottom for more)
head of a bull, body of a man, and master of the labyrinth in crete

.SH SUMMARY
.B asterion 
is a fast, sweet, custom c code navigation tool that visually demonstrates
connections between functions using a radial convergence tree in order to
show maximum interconnectedness in a tight space.

.SH SCOPE, REASONING and DECISION

.B situation (S).  
how to optimally interact with applications is intensely debated -- there are
hundreds of points of view.  any digital environment is made up of thousands of
applications of all sizes and complexities.  every one has a unique interface
and personality.

.B complication (C).  
widely varying comfort, skill-set, and experience of the user base is the root
problem -- both for applications and the system.  most users skim the surface,
some dig deep in one area, some maintain but can not use, very few try to be
both wide and deep.

.B problem (P).  
how do i best serve me ;) i simply don't care about the mouse-using chimps,
touch-screen snot-gobblers, and fucking voice control bullshit :o as the say:
gui's (and all the others) keep simple things simple and make hard things
impossible.

.B my solution (M).  
already pioneered.  move to a standard, one-hundred percent modal keyboard
interface based on an expanded vi/vim-like system.  i will clean it up,
expand it to 3d, machine control, timelines, etc, and apply it ruthlessly to
my applications.

.B target user (T).  
very technical, well-versed, power user.

.B drawbacks...
   -- steep learning curve (already done, don't care about others)
   -- potential conflicts with so many end-uses (noted)
   -- only standard on my systems (unless i have custom input ;))
   -- takes a lot of time to define up front (mostly done)
   -- takes a lot of willpower to stay with it (no problem)
   -- hard to release my application to others (do not care)

.B benefits...
   -- define and test once, use over-and-over
   -- removes a huge design burden for each application (stardard)
   -- make it easy to add extended features (macros, registers, ...)
   -- fast (for me) to learn a new application's interface
   -- easy to switch back-and-forth between applications (same)
   -- never need a mouse, only good use of joystick and touchpad
