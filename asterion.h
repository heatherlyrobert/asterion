/*---[[ DECISION : SHOULD WE BUILD IT ]]--------------------------------------*

 *   PROBLEM (pr)
 *      program flow can be very hard to grasp, especially when trying to get an
 *      overall picture and follow the flow lines in a reasonably complex set
 *      of source files
 *
 *   OBJECTIVES (o)
 *      - see the entire flow in a reasonably constrained space (all at once)
 *      - able to use resulting diagram to "tell the story" of the program
 *      - focus on internal functions, not external libraries our glibc
 *      - be able to see the function names clearly as labels
 *      - attempt to preserve the function ordering/grouping from source files
 *      - clearly call out orphan/vestigal functions (never called)
 *      - clearly call out functions that don't call other functions (leaves)
 *      - clearly show functions that call many other functions (big drivers)
 *      - use colors and textures to make lines easier to follow
 *      - only use common source analyis tools to create input (ctags, cflow)
 *      - accomodate non-linear, event-driven programs as well
 *      - keep under 1,000 lines of code, maybe 2,000 if really good ;)
 *
 *   ALTERNATIVES and CONSEQUENCES (ac)
 *   
 *      1) well-known integrated IDE
 *         - built-in tools requiring no effort to use
 *         - no ability to adapt to my style of coding
 *         - limited to fairly typical node/edge graphs
 *         - then, locked into a full tool including editor
 *         - zero learning opportunity
 *
 *      2) common scripts and graphing libraries
 *         - mostly pre-built and requiring limited effort to use
 *         - limited ability to adapt to my style of coding
 *         - must bring down and use special libraries
 *         - limited learning opportunity outside configuration
 *
 *      3) build a custom program
 *         - gotta do the coding myself from the ground up
 *         - must setup, maintain, and port it myself
 *         - huge learning opportunity and chance to press my tools harder
 *         - can be kept very tailored and small for me
 *         - great chance to experiment on various display styles
 *
 *   JUDGEMENT
 *      surprise, surpise.  we are going to go with building a custom solution
 *      as it just won't be that much code, we can press our librariies to
 *      harden them down, we want to experiment, and its a huge learning
 *      opportunity both coding and graphically
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *   information graphics are consistent visual shorthand techniques used to
 *   communicate critical, complex, or unwieldy data in unique, stylized, and
 *   simplified ways allowing knowledge to be transferred and digested quickly
 *   and clearly.  these techniques can be separated into charts, diagrams,
 *   graphs, tables, maps, and lists.
 *
 *   cgraph is a 
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *   rtree is a visualization tool for large tree structures which places them
 *   in a radial format for compact viewing and navigation.
 *
 *   variations...
 *      - vtree     : sideways, vertical tree
 *      - htree     : normal tree view
 *      - rtree     : radial tree
 *      - stree     : sunburst tree
 *      - itree     : icicle tree
 *      - ctree     : cone tree
 *      - dtree     : donut tree (two level radial)
 *
 *   rational limitations...
 *      - only handle 3 levels of tree at one time (rest are ignored)
 *      - only display the first 12 characters of names (visual consistency)
 *
 *   will not...
 *      - interactively build or edit them
 *
 *   input format...
 *      - pure and plain ascii text file
 *      - only name field or delimited by proper ascii field separator
 *      - blank lines allowed between root branches (none inside these branches)
 *      - first root branch format determines file layout (spaces, numbers, ...)
 *      - typically follows a three-space indent per level model
 *      - comments allowed if '#' in first column
 *
 *
 *
 *   there are many, stable, accepted, existing programs and utilities have
 *   been built by better programmers and are likely superior in speed, size,
 *   capability, and reliability; BUT, i would not have learned nearly as much
 *   using them, so i follow the adage..
 *
 *   TO TRULY LEARN> do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the men of old;
 *   seek what they sought ~ Matsuo Basho
 *
 *   the underlying idea is to use this build process to learn new programming
 *   capabilities and put additional pressure on me to improve my standards,
 *   maintenance, and coding environment.  just using programs and ideas does
 *   not lead to understanding -- so get messy ;)
 *
